Arduino DSC code for Arduino uno

* needs the digitalWriteFast library. Since the project looks dead I patched the source with some open issues and included a copy here
* needs the PinChangeInt library, available at http://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/downloads/list => take the 2.0.1beta release
* needs the MsTimer2 library, available at http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MsTimer2.html
* needs the LiquidCrystal library, which is included with Arduino IDE
