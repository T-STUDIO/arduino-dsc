Arduino DSC code for Arduino uno

* includes the digitalWriteFast project because it needed an update for Arduino 1.0 and it seems inactive so no updates are being done.
* needs the PinChangeInt library, available at http://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/downloads/list => take the 2.0.1beta release
